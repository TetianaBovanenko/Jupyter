Using Python libraries in Jypyter Notebook such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn and various data manipulation methods I acquired daily advertisement cost, daily ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment), grouped data by campaigns, finding ROMI for each, etc. I built visualizations for the calculated metrics using bar charts, scatter plots and heat maps.
